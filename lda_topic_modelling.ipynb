you off then there is little you can do the point is not to be paranoid what are the realistic chances that someone will steal your work there is also another side of the coin if a publisher is

flaws in your argument with copyright authors have to sell their work to publishers if there is no copyright authors can switch publisher at any time in the first case the position of the publisher is stronger they decide who and what gets published in the latter case the authors are in power say all copies of your book have been printed and your current publisher does n't want for whatever reason print more today your work is lost even if you could have more readers you wo n't it 's out of your control with copyright no one can publish your work against your will so you can create an artificial demand which drives prices up but only for those who are in demand if anyone can print any book authors ca n't sit back they have to write more and more books so that 's better for the readers fewer books will go out of print now you 'll argue that authors wo n't get any money if anyone can pirate their work any time how so if a book is n't published at all no one can pirate it so only published books can be pirated when a book is published you need to make a copy of it scanning proof-reading etc so pirating is n't free it costs money too and time eager fans will buy the book as soon as possible so the author will always get money from the first time publisher but since there is no copyright the author can have their book printed by a second publisher too and get money from two sources if a publisher does n't want to ask for permission well you ca n't force them there is nothing preventing them to print any book but there must be a market too so their copy must have some unique value to the readers maybe its much cheaper as an author that gets me thinking if my current publisher is so expensive that means fewer people buy my books and i could get more per copy if that other publisher printed it not something your publisher will want to hear i 'm sure if your publisher offers you better service than the cheap pirate you can still stay but now it 's a decision not something forced by the law it will hurt your feelings if someone makes a lot of money with a re-print but fact is that this money could have been yours if you had the guts to pick it up you do n't want to take the risk then on what grounds do you demand a share i 'm not saying that there wo n't be problems i 'm saying is that as the author of my work i get more say in the matter the article

       " \"i actually disagree about as heartily with the marked answer to this question as it is possible to first person does not in fact make you emotionally closer to the narrator a lesson i learned the hard way when i wrote an entire novel in the first person only to have the chief criticism come back at me that the main character seemed whiny and self-obsessed when i was looking for cool and distant but ultimately virtuous and heroic it was at that point that the room for the criticism was delivered in an eight-person writer 's circle and the one thing seven people could agree upon was that my heroine was a whiner dissected the uses of first person perspective we discovered the following things men can not in general write female first-person one of the few examples of success is stephen king 's dolores claiborne most other attempts have failed draw your own conclusions as to why this might be the main purpose of first-person is to tell stories in a technique known as the unreliable witness the curious incident of the dog in the night time is an example where the viewpoint character is understood by the reader to have a high-level of autism and the author attempts to relay the experience as the narrator experiences it the reader can then interpret what is really happening for themselves in third person it is presumed that even if the author is not using third person omniscient there is some objective truth to reported thoughts actions and events in third person limited sentences like bob would not even admit to himself may be used to tell the reader about things that even the viewpoint character does not know about their own state of mind the unreliable witness on the other hand expects the author to write in a voice as if they are the viewpoint character the reader must infer the things bob does n't want to admit to himself by reading between the lines some would argue that there is a neutral form of first-person in which the viewpoint character is a witness but not an unreliable one in fact the most powerful way to utilise first-person in this mode is when the viewpoint character is a rube someone who is naive and does not understand the full implications of the situation in which they find themselves pulp thrillers of the 30s 40s and 50s often used this technique because limiting story to one viewpoint allows for punchy efficiency the main characters in pulp stories are often rubes who are being played for fools by their clients and the antagonists this tends to creep in to any first-person narrative that is n't explicitly intended to utilise an unreliable witness note that the narrator remains an unreliable witness if only because they are never privy to all the information necessary to inject the situation with any measure of objectivity for example other characters the viewpoint character meets can have their descriptions coloured by the supposed mood of the viewpoint character for these reasons it tends to be the case that reading a novel in third person limited becomes a more intimate experience for readers in which they can more easily become attached to the characters and hence feel more positively about them in first person the reader is encouraged to form an opinion about the narrator as a very distinct and separate person from them in a pulp thriller the side-effects of this are minimal because people really mostly care about what is happening to the hero as opposed to being encouraged to care about the hero themselves for purely emotional reasons in fact if a viewpoint character in first person keeps referencing how they feel it tends to come across as whining thus it is encouraged to keep first-person novels on a lighter less personal basis for this reason we have to work out a viewpoint character 's motivations feelings shortcomings that they are unaware of etc for ourselves this additional burden on the reader to recontextualise the story subtracting the viewpoint character 's personal quirks is a distancing experience absent from third-person limited ever since that writer 's circle session i have been very careful about employing first-person perspective and would now only do it if i had a very specific reason to convey an unreliable witness or a rube perspective generally speaking heroes of genre do not come across as sympathetically in first-person as third i would not use the first-person to portray a heroic character because nothing takes the shine off a hero like getting deep inside their internal monologue in third person limited it is much easier to excuse a hero 's shortcomings as features of their personality in third person it is easier to root for a deeply flawed hero first person viewpoint characters tend to seem more flawed no matter how much they are outwardly a paragon of virtue\",\n",

receptive to your work they will help you with the contractual complexities of publishing which are very complex indeed what sort of publishing rights are you selling to whom and for how much will they revert back to you if your book goes out of print etc. etc they will support you in myriad other ways the cost of an agent is a commission on your work if it sells and not before usually this amounts to <NUM> edit as mgowen points out there are some incompetent and/or exploitative people in the agenting business too preditors and editors is an award-winning website that can help you check up on agents to make sure they 're on the up-and-up you should also look for agents that are members of aar the association of author 's representatives this is the primary professional organization for literary agents querying an agent usually involves sending a query letter and the first few rarely more than <NUM> pages as a sample agents will specify the exact format they desire and they will almost all be slightly different writers market is one of the better-known resources for agent listings note that they are a paid service they also have print editions for the most part agencies are all on the web these days and they should describe their preferred formats on their site a great resource for learning about how to craft effective query letters is query shark miss snark 's blog also says quite a bit on the subject though that blog is no longer updated i 'm sure there are other good resources out there too if you do a little searching if your query piques the interest of the agent they will usually request a partial basically a larger chunk of your manuscript like <NUM> to <NUM> pages then if they still like what they 're seeing they 'll request the whole thing finally if the agent likes the entire work they will offer representation alternately they may ask to see a rewrite before offering representation there are a number of things to consider at this stage namely how well you and the agent fit numerous agents offer advice about this on their blogs but i wo n't go into detail here once you 've signed a contract with the agent and gone through any revision they 'll begin shopping your book around hopefully everyone loves it there 's a huge multi-house auction and you can retire alternatives while querying agents is the most well-known way to get a book into print there are alternatives you can explore some publishers will accept queries or full manuscripts you may choose to submit directly to these publishers small presses may be more likely to look at your unrepresented work if your book does garner interest you may choose to deal with contract negotiations and the rest of the business side of publishing on your own a better alternative is probably to get an agent at this point it wo n't be hard when you tell them you already have a publisher who wants to buy your book another option vanity /self-publishing is more popular than ever be extremely wary however vanity publishers will disguise themselves as small presses large presses and anything else they think will get you to fork over your hard-earned cash in traditional publishing the money always flows toward the author if you see anything about up-front fees you 're typically looking at a vanity publisher most of these businesses make their money from authors who pay significant sums to have their books published if your main concern is seeing your book in bound form and you do n't mind paying for it this path may be for you just be aware of what you 're getting into vanity presses make their money from authors so they have little incentive to actually sell books they offer no marketing support and your book will not generally be stocked on bookstore shelves or get reviews most books published through these companies sell only a handful of copies it is possible to sell large quantities through self-publishing but it generally requires a lot of hard work on the author 's part promoting and marketing a platform such as speaking engagements can also help even then it 's a bit of a long-shot finally print-on-demand is an emerging alternative which allows books to be printed one-by-one rather than in large runs companies that offer this service typically take a cut of each book sold and are able to remain profitable by keeping minimal inventory publishing through print-on-demand shares some of the pitfalls of vanity press namely the lack of any support from the publisher print-on-demand is probably even less likely to assist with formatting the manuscript for publication however the cost of entry is generally much lower in print-on-demand do your homework this post has already gotten rather long and it 's nowhere near being exhaustive

and easily accessible example of accessible emotion is the killing of bambi 's mother in bambi it 's one of the most popularly referenced moments of movie sadness in the history of cinema and storytelling you do n't need much set up bambi had a mother she was rather needlessly shot by hunters bambi was left alone and afraid in an unforgiving world everyone finds themselves feeling sorry for bambi it 's an aspect of storytelling that pixar have managed several times most notably in finding nemo and at the beginning of up essentially the context of the story itself provides all the information we need to feel the emotion in finding nemo all we know is that an average father and average son lose their average wife/mother within the opening moments could be anybody was just one of those things in up we know that two bright spirited normal people were very much in love and had dreams and that one lost the other and had a feeling he had somehow let her down it 's easy to see and relate to how that situation might occur to anyone at any time the difficulty with something like 9/11 is that the weight of the circumstance is such that it needs a hell of a lot of context to make it make sense when you say to someone that someone flew commercial airliners into some of the world 's tallest and most important buildings the weight of the event is such that you ca n't take it as a personal tragedy it 's too huge for one person to process all at once where you can take a world changing event and make it timeless is when you have found that personal nugget that simultaneously marries the global with the personal for example julius caesar 's death would be too difficult to really comprehend until you boil it down to one guy who maybe went a little too far being summarily executed by a dozen of his best friends including his very closest companion et tu brute shakespeare in fact does several things in julius caesar which make that event timelessly tragic he is careful to portray caesar as ambitious but urbane and possibly reasonable he might possibly be the best god-king rome never had he is portrayed as the perfect statesman rational emotionally stable charismatic and comfortable in power then shakespeare drops in brutus quiet thoughtful considered if he is caesar 's very best friend then that speaks well to caesar 's counsel finally mark antony is here portrayed as the violently passionate young man who idolises caesar the vigour with which he supports caesar and is outraged by the cold and calculated acts of the senate is infectious his passion literally rouses the rabble what shakespeare does is make all of these characters human none of them are perfect all of them are likeable in some sense it is only cassius who is a pure pantomime villain snake-like and predatory he gets to brutus by appealing to the reason that brutus is proud to possess the turning of brutus is pure politics and from there the rest of the events seem somehow inexorable julius caesar boils down the events upon which the roman empire turned to a series of quite understandable human choices each piece in that puzzle is vital and it comes down as far as making brutus quite likable if cassius had been the clear villain not requiring brutus to do his dirty work then we instantly lose a whole dimension in the final battles of julius caesar we understand the point of view of both sides we understand why everyone did what they did and the real tragedy is that we ca n't see how people could have acted another way without significantly betraying their sense of identity of course cassius should have just shut his trap and kept his nose out but we do n't have to care about him so that 's unimportant i think that this leads onto a final point we understand why the hunters shot bambi 's mother possibly less so in the modern era but still enough to make the tragedy we understand why the big fish ate the little fish we understand why carl and ellie put living a life before the childish dreams of exploration we understand the whole situation and that 's what provokes the emotion with 9/11 and i come back to this because it 's the example

full of passengers into a building i 'm not here to argue that case either way all i will say is that when you can tell a story that stands for ages you do give everyone air time and you make it quite plain why it 's a tragedy for everyone except the cold and calculating serpentine intelligence that lurks machiavellian to the core in the shadows and whispers in the ears of those who would be
